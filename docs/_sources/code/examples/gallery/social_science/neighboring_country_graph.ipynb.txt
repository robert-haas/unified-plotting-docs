The `Data selection` menu has a drop-down menu called `Node size` where for example `Life expectancy` can be chosen, so that the node size reflects the life expectancy of each country. Further the sizes can be normalized, so that rather than using the raw value, it is adapted to lie within a certain minimum and maximum size for better visual appearance."
