External graph libraries
########################

The following examples show how to use external graph libraries to create graph objects in many different ways. Such external graph objects can be plotted directly with ``unified_plotting`` by automatic conversion to JGF. Due to the large range of features in these external graph libraries, the following examples currently only show a very limited subset of what is possible. A number of notebook cells still have a ``TODO`` placeholder instead of code, but as compensation there are links to relevant sections in the detailed library documentations if you are interested in using advanced network analysis features.
