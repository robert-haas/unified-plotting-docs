.. _colors:

color
-----

The :code:`color` argument is currently unified across
all plots with Matplotlib and Plotly
that use discrete colors to represent data values or entire vectors.

List of accepted formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Named color**

  - List of accepted values: :ref:`named-color-list`

  - Examples: :code:`"g"`, :code:`"darkseagreen"`, :code:`"tab.green"`, :code:`"xkcd.algae_green"`

- **Hexadecimal triplet**

  - Needs to start with :code:`#` being followed by 6 hexadecimal digits (:code:`0-9` and :code:`A-F`). Letters can be given in lower or upper case.
  - Examples: :code:`"#CC7030"`, :code:`"#00ff00"`

- **Shorthand hexadecimal triplet**

  - Needs to start with :code:`#` being followed by 3 hexadecimal digits (:code:`0-9` and :code:`A-F`). Each digits is doubled automatically, thereby expanding to the 6 digits form. Letters can be given in lower or upper case.
  - Example: :code:`"#0f0"` which is equivalent to :code:`"#00ff00"`

- **RGB**

  - Can be either a string of the form :code:`"rgb(number, number, number)"` or a tuple of the form :code:`(number, number, number)` where number is either an integer from :code:`0 to 255` or a float from :code:`0.0 to 1.0` (gets internally multiplied by 255 and casted to integer).
  - Examples: String :code:`"rgb(51, 51, 255)"`, tuple :code:`(51, 51, 255)` or equivalently string :code:`"rgb(0.2, 0.2, 1.0)"` and tuple :code:`(0.2, 0.2, 1.0)`

- **RGBA**

  - Can be either a string of the form :code:`"rgba(number, number, number, number)"` or a tuple of the form :code:`(number, number, number, number)`. The first three numbers can be either an integer from :code:`0 to 255` or a float from :code:`0.0 to 1.0`. The fourth number needs to be a float from :code:`0.0 to 1.0`.
  - Examples: String :code:`"rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)"` or the equivalent tuple :code:`(0, 255, 0, 0.3)`

List of default colors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default colors were chosen in order to be distinguishable by people with different
color vision deficiencies (CVD) and also to work when plots are converted into grayscale
as it may happen in print:

1. "#6059a0"
2. "#df4828"
3. "#69b190"
4. "#ddaa3c"
5. "#d1c1e1"
6. "#4e96bc"
7. "#95211b"
8. "#a6be54"
9. "#e67932"
10. "#9b62a7"
11. "#4e79c5"
12. "#521a13"
13. "#8cbc68"
14. "#e4632d"
15. "#b58fc2"

These colors were selected from Figure 19 of
Paul Tol's `colour schemes and templates <https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/>`_
by checking that the first 6-7 colors are easily distinguishable
with different color vision deficiencies as simulated with 
`Coblis <https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/>`_.

Example: A scatter plot that uses colors 1 to 6 to demonstrate their approximate
appearance for people with different CVD.
Regarding the content of the plot, it uses a logarithmic y scale to visualize the
exponential growth of confirmed COVID-19 cases in countries of central europe
during February and March 2020.
