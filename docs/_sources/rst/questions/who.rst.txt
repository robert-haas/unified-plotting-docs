Who created this package?
-------------------------

This package was started by `Robert Haas <https://github.com/robert-haas>`__ as part of a thesis. The initial aim was to reduce the complexity of other parts of the project by strictly decoupling code concerned with plot creation from all the rest. These other parts generate various kinds of vector and graph data in the context of cheminformatics, computational drug design and metaheuristic optimization, which required a range of visualizations to become better interpretable. Over time this resulted in an accumulation of plotting code and capabilities, which naturally led to modularization, first in functions, which then became grouped in modules and ultimately led to this package. Special focus was put on interactive graph visualizations to better explore biochemical reaction networks as well as inheritence relationships between individuals in evolutionary algorithms.


Who supported it?
-----------------

The thesis during which this package got started was generously supported by the `Theoretical Biochemistry Group <https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/>`__ and `Pharmacoinformatics Research Group <https://pharminfo.univie.ac.at>`__ at the `University of Vienna <https://www.univie.ac.at/en/>`__ and by `Inte:Ligand <http://www.inteligand.com>`__. My gratitude and thanks go to everyone who was involved along the way and made this project possible!
